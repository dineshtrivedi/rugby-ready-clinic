## SEEING THROUGH THE FOG

In this time of uncertainty for schools rugby and rugby in general I would like to offer 12 determined players the opportunity to have the same amount of preparation I was fortunate enough to have before my national week(2009).

In times like these, it is the one willing to take responsibility for their own destiny and dreams that will succeed.
